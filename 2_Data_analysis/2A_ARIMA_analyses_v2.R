# A. Model form selection
# 
# 1. Evaluate stationarity (of full timeseries and each year alone)

# The basic stationarity diagnostics are the following:
# 
#   1. Plot your data. 
ts.plot(max_biomass_2016, ylab = "Max. biomass (ug/L)")
ts.plot(max_biomass_2017, ylab = "Max. biomass (ug/L)")
ts.plot(max_biomass_2018, ylab = "Max. biomass (ug/L)")
ts.plot(max_biomass_2019, ylab = "Max. biomass (ug/L)")

ts.plot(peak_depth_2016, ylab = "Peak depth (m)")
ts.plot(peak_depth_2017, ylab = "Peak depth (m)")
ts.plot(peak_depth_2018, ylab = "Peak depth (m)")
ts.plot(peak_depth_2019, ylab = "Peak depth (m)")

ts.plot(peak_magnitude_2017, ylab = "Peak magnitude (ug/L)")
ts.plot(peak_magnitude_2018, ylab = "Peak magnitude (ug/L)")

# LOOK FOR: 
#     A. An increasing trend
# - max biomass and peak magnitude increase over the season
# - peak depth may decrease over the season?
# - peak width doesn't look like it increases or decreases
#     B. A non-zero level (if no trend)
# - peak width looks like it might have a level ~3
#     C. Strange shocks or steps in your data (indicating something dramatic changed like the data collection methodology)
# - something funky about peak depth at the end of 2017; it's very static

#   2. Apply stationarity tests

#     A. adf.test() p-value should be less than 0.05 (reject null)
#     B. kpss.test() p-value should be greater than 0.05 (do not reject null)
#   3. If stationarity tests are failed, then try differencing to correct
#     Try ndiffs() in the forecast package or manually try different differences.

# 2. Selection of the differencing level (d) â€“ to fix stationarity problems
#     See point 3 in stationarity diagnostics above.
# - overall, max_biomass and peak_magnitude should probably all be differenced by 1
# - peak_depth only needs a diff in 2016 and it could be either 1 or 2 depending on test
# - peak_width doesn't need to be differenced

# 3. Selection of the AR level (p)
for (i in 1:4){
  fit <- auto.arima(all.ts[[i]])
  print(fit)
  checkresiduals(fit)
  fc <- forecast(fit, h = 4)
  plot(fc)
}
# 4. Selection of the MA level (q)
# B. Parameter estimation
# 
# C. Model checking


##NOTES:

# use the following to get you started on an algorithm of all possible combinations
# https://stat.ethz.ch/R-manual/R-devel/library/utils/html/combn.html

# do this for auto.arima() to see which is best. save the aicc

# that's it.
