A study examining controls on phytoplankton community spatial distribution and composition over time.

Driving questions:

1. What are the primary environmental drivers of community spatial (depth) distribution over time, and how do they affect spatial distribution?

2. What is the relationship between spatial distribution and community structure over time?
