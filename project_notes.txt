From CCC 05JAN21
I apologize for taking so long to respond to you re: these plots (COOL!). 
Take all of these notes for the chapter, not the VLWA abstract:
I really like the framing of increasing mixing/disturbance = lower diversity 
(this was actually the major hypothesis that was tested in the GLEON Spring blitz WG!).  nice!!
Additional questions: I’m wondering if you can share plots of 
1) a time series of light availability at the thermocline - and maybe also density plots? 
2) the time series of Schmidt over time and also a density plot? 
3) how much does the duration of time series each summer affect the kernel plots? 
From looking at the peak depth time series, I’m wondering how going through the end of September when stability is naturally weakening anyway affects results. 
What if you truncated to to the minimum time for all years (looks like 2018 is the shortest year of data, so would then base it on those start/stop dates) so you have equal coverage? 
Then we would also be focusing primarily on the true stratified period.
I agree that the time series plots are not as easy to interpret so I prefer the density ones too, but just want to make sure we aren’t missing anything!
